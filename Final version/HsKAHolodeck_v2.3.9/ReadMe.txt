*Added a button to enable/disable pop-up menus
*The menu now closes if you don't direct the gaze on it 
*The menu stays active when the buttons or the text is focused. The panel cannot be focused,
and the menu will shut down even if the gaze is on it.
 - We removed the panel, as we could not find a working solution
