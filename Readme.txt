Pop Up menu in process:

*the menu is not yet developed
*instead of the menu there is only text 
*if the face is rotating then the text is rotating as well
*when placing the face the text will remain at the same relative position from the face
*text is visible above the face

*prefab for popUpMenu
*activating and disactivating the prefab itself
*it is is a working version, no errors but the pop up menu buttons are not fully functional
*the funtionality of the buttons from the pop up menu is not yet implemented, only the apearance of the menu itself

*faces can rotate individually

*faces can watch the camera individually

*faces can rotate at 3 different speeds: "Slow", "Normal" and "Fast"
 -these speeds are local

*Global WatchMe and Rotation override the local WatchMe and Rotation, including speed of rotation

*A line of text displays the current rotation speed on the PopUp Menu. This choice was made in order
to clarify that the speed displayed on the button is the one currently affecting the face, 
not the one to be activated upon clicking

*Added a button to enable/disable pop-up menus
*The menu now closes if you don't direct the gaze on it 
*The menu stays active when the buttons or the text is focused. The panel cannot be focused,
and the menu will shut down even if the gaze is on it.
